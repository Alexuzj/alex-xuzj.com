                <h4><p>My curiosity drives me to dive deep into urban challenges, turning them into innovative solutions. This inquisitive spirit keeps me engaged in urban design, where every project is an opportunity to refine my approach and achieve meaningful results. During my time at Cornell, I discovered just how closely design strategy development is tied to community and urban growth, which has become a central focus of my work<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm fascinated by how design and system strategies can build sustainable, equitable communities. Understanding people and their needs is at the heart of what I do, allowing me to create stories and visuals that inspire impactful urban development. My background in urban planning, design, and community engagement, along with my knack for communication, helps me bridge the gap between strategy and action for clients.
